When consultants leave, they take their knowledge with them, leaving organizations no better equipped than when they arrived.\n\nThe Dependency Trap: Most consulting firms have a business model that incentivizes continued engagement rather than client independence. The longer a project runs, the more billable hours generated. This creates a fundamental conflict of interest.\n\nThe Alternative: A new model is emerging where success is measured by how quickly clients become self-sufficient. This approach prioritizes knowledge transfer, capability building, and sustainable practices over extended engagements."
